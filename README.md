# Sorting-Algorithms-Java
This was an assignment I completed for my Post AP Data Structures and Algorithms class.
## Assignment Details
I wrote an implementation of each sorting algorithm we discussed for arrays of ints in class. I was provided 6 .txt files. These are text files of lists of ints between 1 and 1,000,000. Each file is named “arrayX.txt” where X is the length of the lists. I had to process each of these files separately. 

I Wrote a program, called sortingOutSorting.java, that reads in the file and sorts each array using each sorting algorithm and keeps track of how long each takes. For this to work well, I had to make sure each sorting algorithm did not change the original array. I Kept track of how long each algorithm took on each list and output the data into an excel spreadsheet. 

In the end, I had 6 different output files. For each array that was sorted I had 8 outputs. I Put them into one list and put all the lists for a given input file into one output file called "outputX.csv" where X is the length of the sorted lists.


The sorts I implemented:


Bubble

Insertion

Selection

Merge

Heapsort

Shellsort

Quicksort

Counting
